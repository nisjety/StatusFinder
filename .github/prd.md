## 🧭 Development Steps

1. **Initialize the Scrapy Project**

   ```bash
   scrapy startproject discovery
   ```

2. **Set Up Version Control**

   * Initialize a Git repository.
   * Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and directories.

3. **Define Items**

   * In `items.py`, define data structures for the scraped data using Scrapy's `Item` and `Field` classes.

4. **Implement Middlewares and Pipelines**

   * In `middlewares.py`, implement custom middlewares for request/response processing.
   * In `pipelines.py`, define pipelines for data processing and storage.

5. **Configure Settings**

   * In `settings.py`, configure project settings such as user agents, download delays, concurrent requests, and pipelines.

6. **Develop Spiders**

   * **BaseSpider**: Provides common functionality for all spiders.
   * **QuickSpider**: Extends `BaseSpider` for ultra-fast URL status validation.
   * **StatusSpider**: Extends `QuickSpider` to check basic status and metadata of URLs.
   * **MultiSpider**: Extends `BaseSpider` to crawl multiple pages using Playwright for JavaScript rendering.
   * **SEOSpider**: Extends `MultiSpider` to focus on performance metrics and security.
   * **VisualSpider**: Extends `SEOSpider` to build a visual-oriented sitemap.
   * **WorkflowSpider**: Extends `MultiSpider` to support complex web workflows with human interaction.

7. **Implement Unit Tests**

   * Use `unittest` or `pytest` frameworks to write tests for spiders, middlewares, and pipelines.

8. **Set Up Scrapyd for Deployment**

   * Install Scrapyd on the deployment server.
   * Configure `scrapy.cfg` with the deployment target.
   * Deploy spiders using the `scrapyd-deploy` command.

9. **Monitor and Maintain**

   * Use Scrapyd's API or web interface to monitor spider jobs.
   * Implement logging and error handling for maintenance and debugging.

## 🧑‍💻 Coding Standards and Best Practices

Adhering to coding standards ensures code readability, maintainability, and scalability. Below are the recommended practices:

### 1. **Follow PEP 8 Guidelines**

* **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
* **Line Length**: Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
* **Blank Lines**: Separate top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines, and method definitions inside a class with one blank line.
* **Imports**: Place imports at the top of the file, grouped in the following order: standard library imports, related third-party imports, and local application/library-specific imports.
* **Naming Conventions**:

  * Modules: `lowercase_with_underscores`
  * Classes: `CapWords`
  * Functions and Variables: `lowercase_with_underscores`
  * Constants: `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`
  * ([PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/))

### 2. **Adopt the Zen of Python**

Incorporate the guiding principles of Python's design philosophy to write clean and efficient code:

* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Explicit is better than implicit.
* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Flat is better than nested.
* Sparse is better than dense.
* Readability counts.
* ([Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/))

### 3. **Implement Logging**

* Use Python's built-in `logging` module instead of print statements.
* Configure appropriate logging levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).
* Include timestamps in log messages for better traceability.
* ([Logging HOWTO — Python 3 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html))

### 4. **Write Comprehensive Docstrings**

* Use triple double quotes (`"""`) for docstrings.
* Include a brief description, parameters, return values, and exceptions raised.
* Follow PEP 257 conventions for docstring formatting.
* ([PEP 257 – Docstring Conventions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/))

### 5. **Maintain Modular Code**

* Break down code into reusable modules and functions.
* Each module should have a single responsibility.
* Avoid code duplication by abstracting common functionalities.

### 6. **Use Virtual Environments**

* Create a virtual environment for the project using `venv` or `virtualenv`.
* Activate the environment before installing dependencies.
* Maintain a `requirements.txt` file with all project dependencies.

### 7. **Handle Exceptions Gracefully**

* Use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions.
* Log exceptions with appropriate error messages.
* Avoid bare except clauses; catch specific exceptions.

### 8. **Optimize Scrapy Settings**

* **AutoThrottle**: Enable to automatically adjust crawling speed based on load.
* **HTTPCache**: Use during development to cache responses and reduce load on target servers.
* **Download Delays**: Set appropriate delays between requests to prevent overloading servers.
* **Concurrent Requests**: Configure the number of concurrent requests per domain/IP.
* ([Scrapy Best Practices](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/practices.html))

### 9. **Respect Robots.txt**

* Set `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY = True` in `settings.py` to respect the target website's robots.txt rules.
* ([Scrapy Settings Reference](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html))

### 10. **Implement Unit Tests**

* Write tests for individual components using `unittest` or `pytest`.
* Ensure tests are isolated and do not depend on external resources.
* Use mock objects to simulate external dependencies.

By following this structured approach and adhering to the outlined coding standards and best practices, your `discovery` Scrapy project will be well-equipped for scalable, maintainable, and efficient web crawling operations.
